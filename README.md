## About the Project
Nurtured from the seed of a single great idea - to empower the traveller â€“ Traveller's Arena is India's online travel guide/blog. Traveller's Arena came to life to empower the Indian traveller with instant travel suggestions by the travellers themselves. By using this website, you can spend less time searching the internet and being overwhelmed with information and more time doing the one thing you want to do: travel. Plan your first wonderful trip by reading our suggestions under List of Places. This project has been built as a part of PPL - Mini Project.
